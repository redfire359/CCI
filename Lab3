Ubuntu server (user01:root)
sudo apt install telnetd -y 

(change to bridged adapter)

*********iptables setup********

1. check you current filter table rules (should be blank)
sudo iptables -nvL

2. On an seperate machine, telnet into the server 
telnet IP 
exit

3. Now switch back to the VM, we are going to drop packets going to telnet (port 23) 
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 23 -j DROP
  **Since this is on the INPUT chain, only telnet packets coming from the outside will be dropped
  
Start a TCPdump to view the incoming icmp traffic for next question
sudo tcpdump icmp
  
4. Now ping the virtual machine 
ping IP 

**view echo requests/replies
5. Drop packets based on packet type
ctrl+C tcpdump
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
sudo tcpdump icmp

6. Try to ping the machine again
ping IP 

7. view tcpdump sending echo requests (Coming in) but no repies (Not going out)

8. Now block output aswell
