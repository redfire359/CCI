LAB 3 

1. Learning objectives
-Usage of iptables for firewall administration
-Utilizing tcpdump to view network traffic and verify iptable rules
-Installation of the apache2 web service
-Ways to check statuses of services
-Usage of ufw for firewall administration
-Differneces between iptables and ufw

LAB 3 SETUP
-create user01
-sudo apt install telnetd -y 
-sudo apt install iptables-persistent
-(change to bridged adapter)

*********iptables setup********

1. check you current filter table rules (should be blank)
sudo iptables -nvL

2. On an seperate machine, telnet into the server 
telnet IP 
exit

3. Now switch back to the VM, we are going to drop packets going to telnet (port 23) 
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 23 -j DROP
  **Since this is on the INPUT chain, only telnet packets coming from the outside will be dropped
  
Start a TCPdump to view the incoming icmp traffic for next question
sudo tcpdump icmp
  
4. Now ping the virtual machine 
ping IP 

**view echo requests/replies
5. Drop packets based on packet type
ctrl+C tcpdump
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
sudo tcpdump icmp

6. Try to ping the machine again
ping IP 

7. view tcpdump sending echo requests (Coming in) but no replies (Not going out)

8. set up logging for iptables rules
iptables -F
iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "IPtables input: "
iptables -A INPUT -i icmp

*ping the VM
cat /var/log/syslog | grep iptables
**view the input and how you store it

9. Saving iptables
iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/iptables/rules.v4
iptables -nvL
iptables -F
iptables -nvL
iptables-restore /etc/iptables/rules.v4
This is mainly used when a server reboots and the ip rules are no longer in place, since iptables is not persistent



*********http server setup********
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo ufw app list
sudo ufw allow 'Apache'
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
sudo systemctl status apache2
*press q to quit

hostname -I to get your IP address
open your Kali  VM and type in the IP address, coming to the apache webpage
